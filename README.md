# tic-react-toe

I guess it's a rite of passage to create a tic tac toe game. 

This was an interesting experience on practicing with React's hooks and context API, as well as learn more about CSS Grid.

## Getting started

-Clone the repository to your local folder.

-Run `npm i`

-Run `npm start` to start localhost server at port 3000.
